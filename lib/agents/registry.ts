/**
 * The typed tool registry (§9 / §10 of the production-readiness guide).
 *
 * Every tool the agent runtime can execute is declared here exactly once,
 * with the facts the backend needs to decide whether to run it: what
 * permission it costs, what it would break if it went wrong, whether it
 * changes anything, how long it may take, whether a retry is safe, and
 * whether a person has to say yes first.
 *
 * Two rules keep this honest:
 *
 * 1. **A tool that is not in this registry does not execute.** `policy.ts`
 *    denies unknown names outright rather than falling through to the legacy
 *    switch in lib/ask-aval/tools.ts. Registering a tool is a deliberate act.
 * 2. **Risk level and `mutates` are declared, not derived.** A reader should
 *    be able to answer "what is the worst this agent can do" from this file
 *    alone, without tracing executors.
 *
 * Today every registered tool is read-only, `record_preference` excepted.
 * The gated entries at the bottom are declared with no executor: they define
 * the envelope the first mutating tool will land inside, and `policy.ts`
 * denies them until an executor is wired, so declaring one grants nothing.
 */

 * - `medium`   — creates a draft or internal record. Automatic if policy passes.
 * - `high`     — externally visible or hard to walk back. Stronger validation.
 * - `critical` — money, contracts, deletion, permissions. Approval required.
