/**
 * Controlled agent-to-agent delegation (§19).
 *
 * The useful case is real: a Financial Analyst working a liquidity goal finds
 * a lease-expiration cluster and wants Lease Review's reading of the actual
 * documents, rather than guessing at terms it cannot see. The dangerous case
 * is equally real: agents invoking each other without a bound, each hop
 * spending the workspace's money, none of them individually wrong.
 *
 * Four limits, all deterministic and none of them advisory:
 *
 * 1. **An allow-list of pairs**, not a general capability. Delegation is a
 *    declared relationship between two roles, so the reachable graph is
 *    readable in one table instead of emergent at runtime.
 * 2. **A depth cap** (policy.ts). A → B → C is the most that can happen.
 * 3. **A shared budget.** The child's steps come out of the parent's
 *    remaining allowance, so a chain cannot cost more than one task.
 * 4. **The child never holds authority the parent lacks.** Its permissions are
 *    the intersection of the two envelopes, so delegation can only ever
 *    narrow. Otherwise "ask Lease Review to read it for you" becomes the
 *    documented way around a permission boundary.
