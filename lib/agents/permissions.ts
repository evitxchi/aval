/**
 * Permission envelopes — what each agent is *allowed* to do, expressed
 * independently of what any model proposes.
 *
 * This file exists because of one inversion the architecture audit found
 * (docs/AGENT_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md, gap 1): tool access was enforced only by
 * filtering the schema list handed to the model. That makes the model the
 * enforcer of its own permissions. Everything here is the deterministic half
 * of the answer — read at execution time, never derived from model output,
 * never influenced by anything inside a prompt or a tool result.
 *
 * The envelopes follow §17 of the production-readiness guide: the agent with
 * the widest visibility (Risk Analyst) gets the least mutation authority, and
 * no agent holds a write permission it does not need for its own job.
 */

/**
 * One capability, named as `<domain>.<action>`. Tools declare which one they
