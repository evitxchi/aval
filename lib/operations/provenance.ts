/**
 * How a row changes when a connected system reports something about it.
 *
 * The premise of connecting a portfolio's whole stack is that the pieces
 * disagree. A PMS and an accounting system will not report the same rent for
 * the same unit forever, and the obvious implementation — write whatever
 * arrived most recently — produces a dashboard that is confidently wrong with
 * nothing on screen to indicate it. That is the same failure mode the
 * faithfulness gate and the audit chain exist to prevent, one layer further
 * down, so this module refuses it in the same way: keep both values, flag the
 * field, let a person decide.
 *
 * The decision itself — which of three rules applies to an incoming value —
 * lives in `merge.ts`, which has no database in it and is re-exported from
 * here so callers still import from one place. This module is the part that
 * touches storage: writing conflicts, listing them, resolving them.
