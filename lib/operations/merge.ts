/**
 * How a stored row changes when a connected system reports something about it
 * — the decision, with no database in it.
 *
 * Split out of `provenance.ts` so these rules can be pinned by tests that run
 * under `node --test` with no Cloudflare D1 binding, the same pure/impure
 * split `lib/operations/metrics/` uses. `provenance.ts` re-exports everything
 * here, so callers still import from one place.
 *
 * Three rules, in order:
 *
 * 1. A source is authoritative for its OWN rows. Incoming data from the source
 *    that wrote the stored row is an update, flagged as nothing — this is the
 *    ordinary re-sync path, and treating it as a conflict would flag every
 *    changed rent in the system every night.
 *
 * 2. Filling a gap is a merge, not a conflict. A second source supplying a
 *    value where the stored row has `null` is strictly new information.
 *
 * 3. Changing a value across sources is a conflict. The stored value stays,
 *    the incoming one is recorded, and the field is contested until someone
 *    resolves it. Last-write-wins here is how a dashboard ends up confidently
 *    wrong with nothing on screen to indicate it.

 *
 * `fields` is explicit rather than "every key on the incoming object" so that

 * connector that was never meant to own it.
 *
 * `undefined` on an incoming field means "this source did not report it",
 * which is different from `null` meaning "this source reports it as empty".
 * Only the second can clear a value, and only from the owning source — a
 * secondary source reporting a blank is not evidence that the value it does
 * not have does not exist.
