/**
 * POST /api/infrastructure/bills/extract
 *
 * Turns a utility bill's raw text into structured fields a user can review
 * and confirm before it's saved as a `utility_bills` row. Never persists by
 * itself — extraction is a draft, the same "AI proposes, a human writes it"
 * shape as Ask Aval's draft/decision flows elsewhere in this app.
 *
 * A GitHub sourcing pass for utility-bill parsing (docs/DECISIONS.md) found
 * nothing beyond a 0-star proof-of-concept — production tools in this space
 * are commercial data brokers (Urjanet/Arcadia-style), not OSS. Aval already
 * has a Claude client wired in for document work (lib/ask-aval/anthropic.ts)
 * — reusing it for structured extraction is more realistic than adopting a
 * fragile scraper/OCR pipeline, and it costs against the same per-org daily
 * cap and token balance as every other model call in this app.

const SYSTEM = `You extract structured data from a single utility bill's raw text, for a property-management system that will let a human review and confirm your reading before it's saved.

Hard rules:
- Only report values that actually appear in the text (arithmetic to normalize units or currency to cents is fine; inventing a missing figure is not).
- If a required field is missing or ambiguous in the text, make your best reading but set confidence to "low" and say what was uncertain in "note". Never guess silently.
- cost_cents must be the total amount due, in minor units of the bill's own currency.
Call extract_utility_bill exactly once. Write no prose outside it.`;
