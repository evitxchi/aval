/**
 * A tamper-evident chain over what Ask Aval did to produce an answer.
 *
 * Aval's whole claim is that a figure it states was verified against real
 * tool output by the faithfulness gate. Today that claim is only as good as
 * trusting the running process. This chain makes it checkable after the fact:
 * each entry commits to the entry before it, so removing, reordering or
 * editing any link is detectable by recomputing the hashes.
 *
 * **It stores digests, not content.** A tool result can contain resident
 * names and account balances; an audit table full of those would be a second
 * copy of the most sensitive data in the system, retained indefinitely for
 * bookkeeping. So each entry keeps a SHA-256 of the payload plus a few
 * non-identifying facts (which tool ran, how many numbers it returned,
 * whether the gate passed). That is enough to prove *what happened*, and to
 * re-verify a retained answer against the chain, without the log becoming a
 * liability of its own. Same discipline as `lib/ask-aval/preferences.ts`:
 * keep the structure, drop the content.
 */

/**
 * Event kinds the chain can carry.
 *
 * The first four are the original Ask Aval answer trail. The rest were added
 * with the durable agent runtime (lib/agents/) to meet §15 of the production
 * readiness guide, which wants the policy decision, the approval, the retry
 * and the task lifecycle recorded, not only the tool calls.
 *
 * Adding a kind is safe for chains already written: `serializeEntry` below is
 * unchanged, so every existing entry still hashes to the same value. Changing
 * or reordering that function's fields would not be safe, and must not happen.
