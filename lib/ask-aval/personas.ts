/**
 * Named agent personas layered on top of the existing Ask Aval tool loop
 * (loop.ts) — a config table, not a new agent framework. A GitHub sourcing
 * pass (docs/DECISIONS.md) found no TS-native agent framework (Vercel AI
 * SDK, Mastra, LangChain.js, Cloudflare's own Durable-Object-based agents
 * SDK) that knows about this app's faithfulness gate or usage metering;
 * adopting one would mean reimplementing those safety checks inside
 * someone else's abstraction for what that same research found is, in
 * every real system examined, just a `{id, systemPromptAddition,
 * toolSubset}` registry. Every persona still runs through the same
 * runAskAvalLoop, faithfulness gate, and usage caps as the default
 * assistant — only the system-prompt framing and the tool subset change.
 *
 * `PersonaId` is intentionally duplicated (not imported) in
 * app/components/agent-avatar/personas.ts, a client component module —
 * keeping the ids in sync by convention avoids pulling any server-only
 * Ask Aval code into the client bundle for a handful of string literals.
