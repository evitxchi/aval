/**
 * The other half of closed-loop learning: not what a user said (that's
 * preferences.ts), but what they actually did. Aggregated fresh from real
 * action tables at request time — insight_decisions, automation_runs,
 * draft_documents — rather than a separately maintained "learned" table,
 * so it can never drift stale and needs no background job to refresh it.
 *
 * Every field aggregated here (insight id, decision, automation status,
 * document format/type) is already a small fixed-cardinality label, never
 * free text — so this is privacy-safe by construction, the same guarantee
 * preferences.ts gets from its fixed vocabulary, without needing one here.
 *
 * A single occurrence is not a pattern: every bucket below requires a
 * minimum count before it's surfaced, so one early denial doesn't get
 * reported to the model as "this workspace denies X."
