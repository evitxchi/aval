 * How many verified figures the pairwise expansion below is allowed to run on.

 * the gate admitted 4% of them with 3 verified numbers, 22% with 8, 76% with
 * 20, and 99% with 40. Past a few dozen figures the gate was not filtering
 * anything; it was passing almost everything.
 *
 * That mattered little when tools returned a handful of numbers. It matters a
 * great deal now that the operations tools return whole statements — a P&L
 * with expense lines, aging buckets, and per-vendor scorecards is easily
 * forty-plus figures in one result.
 *
 * So the expansion is capped rather than tuned. Above the cap it is skipped
 * entirely, which costs nothing real: a tool result rich enough to exceed it
 * already contains every derived figure a model should cite — the operations
 * tools compute `outstandingCents`, `collectionRatePct`, `compliancePct` and
 * `noiCents` themselves precisely so the model never has to derive them, and
 * `get_portfolio_metrics` has always returned `collection_rate_pct` the same
 * way. Below the cap the original behavior is unchanged, so a small answer
